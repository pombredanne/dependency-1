 - Add support for private resolvers
   - what is remaining is the TODO in api/app/lib/RemoteDirectory.scala
 - Add Authorization object to restrict views of key objects to public
   / private records user can see
   - This is already implemented for the Resolvers class... consider if
     we want to build a SAAS groups model here or not.
